# Hi there, I'm Suwit Saiso! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

Hello, my name is Suwit Saiso. I recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Naresuan University. During my studies, I developed an interest in web development and started creating small personal projects, such as a meeting room booking system and my own portfolio website.

I have a foundation in programming with Python, C, C#, and JavaScript. Iâ€™ve worked with Flask and Django for backend development and have basic knowledge of databases as well.

Iâ€™m a fast learner who enjoys problem-solving, and Iâ€™m genuinely interested in becoming a backend developer. I'm excited to apply for this position because Iâ€™m looking for an opportunity to grow and learn from an experienced team.
